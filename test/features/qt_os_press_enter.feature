Feature: MobyBehaviour::QT::Os#press_enter
  As a test scripter writer
  I want to use press_enter method to [DO_SOMETHING] in [TARGET_APPLICATION]
  so that I can test the MobyBehaviour::QT::Os behaviour

  Scenario: Testing press_enter method with required argument(s) (Rename this to be more descriptive)
    Given I launch application [APPLICATION_NAME] as @app
    When I execute "@app.[SOME_OBJECT].press_enter()"
    Then [ADD_YOUR_VERIFICATION_HERE]

  Scenario: Testing press_enter method with optional argument 'interval' (Rename this to be more descriptive)
    Given I launch application [APPLICATION_NAME] as @app
    When I execute "@app.[SOME_OBJECT].press_enter(interval)"
    Then [ADD_YOUR_VERIFICATION_HERE]
