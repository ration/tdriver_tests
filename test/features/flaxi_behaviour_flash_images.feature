Feature: MobyBehaviour::FlaxiBehaviour#flash_images
  As a test scripter writer
  I want to use flash_images method to [DO_SOMETHING] in [TARGET_APPLICATION]
  so that I can test the MobyBehaviour::FlaxiBehaviour behaviour

  Scenario: Testing flash_images method with required argument(s) (Rename this to be more descriptive)
    Given I launch application [APPLICATION_NAME] as @app
    When I execute "@app.[SOME_OBJECT].flash_images()"
    Then [ADD_YOUR_VERIFICATION_HERE]

  Scenario: Testing flash_images method with optional argument 'flash_files' (Rename this to be more descriptive)
    Given I launch application [APPLICATION_NAME] as @app
    When I execute "@app.[SOME_OBJECT].flash_images(flash_files)"
    Then [ADD_YOUR_VERIFICATION_HERE]
