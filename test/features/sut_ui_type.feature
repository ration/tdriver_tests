Feature: MobyBehaviour::SUT#ui_type
  As a test scripter writer
  I want to use ui_type attribute to [DO_SOMETHING] in [TARGET_APPLICATION]
  so that I can test the MobyBehaviour::SUT behaviour

  Scenario: Testing ui_type attribute (Rename this to be more descriptive)
    Given I launch application [APPLICATION_NAME] as @app
    When I execute "@app.[SOME_OBJECT].ui_type"
    Then [ADD_YOUR_VERIFICATION_HERE]
