  I want to use get_object method to [DO_SOMETHING] in [TARGET_APPLICATION]
  so that I can test the MobyBehaviour::SUT behaviour

  Scenario: Testing get_object method with required argument(s) (Rename this to be more descriptive)
    Given I launch application [APPLICATION_NAME] as @app
    When I execute "@app.[SOME_OBJECT].get_object(object_id)"
    Then [ADD_YOUR_VERIFICATION_HERE]
