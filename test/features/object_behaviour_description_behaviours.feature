Feature: MobyBehaviour::ObjectBehaviourDescription#behaviours
  As a test scripter writer
  I want to use behaviours method to [DO_SOMETHING] in [TARGET_APPLICATION]
  so that I can test the MobyBehaviour::ObjectBehaviourDescription behaviour

  Scenario: Testing behaviours method with required argument(s) (Rename this to be more descriptive)
    Given I launch application [APPLICATION_NAME] as @app
    When I execute "@app.[SOME_OBJECT].behaviours()"
    Then [ADD_YOUR_VERIFICATION_HERE]

  Scenario: Testing behaviours method with optional argument 'return_indexes' (Rename this to be more descriptive)
    Given I launch application [APPLICATION_NAME] as @app
    When I execute "@app.[SOME_OBJECT].behaviours(return_indexes)"
    Then [ADD_YOUR_VERIFICATION_HERE]
