Feature: MobyBehaviour::QT::SUT#close_qttas
  As a test scripter writer
  I want to use close_qttas method to shutdown the qttas server
  so that I can test the MobyBehaviour::QT::SUT behaviour

  #Scenario: Testing close_qttas method 
    #Given I have default sut
    #When I execute "@sut.close_qttas"
    #Then exception is not thrown
