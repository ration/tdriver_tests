Feature: MobyBehaviour::QT::Widget#long_press
  As a test scripter writer
  I want to use long_press method to [DO_SOMETHING] in [TARGET_APPLICATION]
  so that I can test the MobyBehaviour::QT::Widget behaviour

  Scenario: Testing long_press method with required argument(s) (Rename this to be more descriptive)
    Given I launch application [APPLICATION_NAME] as @app
    When I execute "@app.[SOME_OBJECT].long_press()"
    Then [ADD_YOUR_VERIFICATION_HERE]

  Scenario: Testing long_press method with optional argument 'time' (Rename this to be more descriptive)
    Given I launch application [APPLICATION_NAME] as @app
    When I execute "@app.[SOME_OBJECT].long_press(time)"
    Then [ADD_YOUR_VERIFICATION_HERE]

  Scenario: Testing long_press method with optional argument 'button' (Rename this to be more descriptive)
    Given I launch application [APPLICATION_NAME] as @app
    When I execute "@app.[SOME_OBJECT].long_press(time, button)"
    Then [ADD_YOUR_VERIFICATION_HERE]
