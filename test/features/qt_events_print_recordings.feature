Feature: MobyBehaviour::QT::Events#print_recordings

  I want to use print_recordings method to [DO_SOMETHING] in [TARGET_APPLICATION]
  so that I can test the MobyBehaviour::QT::Events behaviour

  Scenario: Testing print_recordings method with required argument(s) (Rename this to be more descriptive)

    When I execute "@app.[SOME_OBJECT].print_recordings()"
    Then [ADD_YOUR_VERIFICATION_HERE]
