  so that I can test the MobyBehaviour::SutController behaviour

  Scenario: Testing execution_order method with required argument(s) (Rename this to be more descriptive)
    Given I launch application [APPLICATION_NAME] as @app
    When I execute "@app.[SOME_OBJECT].execution_order()"
    Then [ADD_YOUR_VERIFICATION_HERE]
