Feature: MobyBehaviour::Find#find
  As a test scripter writer
  I want to use find method to [DO_SOMETHING] in [TARGET_APPLICATION]
  so that I can test the MobyBehaviour::Find behaviour

  Scenario: Testing find method with required argument(s) (Rename this to be more descriptive)
    Given I launch application [APPLICATION_NAME] as @app
    When I execute "@app.[SOME_OBJECT].find()"
    Then [ADD_YOUR_VERIFICATION_HERE]

  Scenario: Testing find method with optional argument 'find_hash' (Rename this to be more descriptive)
    Given I launch application [APPLICATION_NAME] as @app
    When I execute "@app.[SOME_OBJECT].find(find_hash)"
    Then [ADD_YOUR_VERIFICATION_HERE]
