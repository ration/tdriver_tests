  so that I can test the MobyBehaviour::QT::SUT behaviour

  Scenario: Testing system_information method with required argument(s) (Rename this to be more descriptive)
    Given I launch application [APPLICATION_NAME] as @app
    When I execute "@app.[SOME_OBJECT].system_information()"
    Then [ADD_YOUR_VERIFICATION_HERE]
