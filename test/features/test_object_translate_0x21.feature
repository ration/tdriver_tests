Feature: MobyBehaviour::TestObject#translate!
  As a test scripter writer
  I want to use translate! method to [DO_SOMETHING] in [TARGET_APPLICATION]
  so that I can test the MobyBehaviour::TestObject behaviour

  Scenario: Testing translate! method with required argument(s) (Rename this to be more descriptive)
    Given I launch application [APPLICATION_NAME] as @app
    When I execute "@app.[SOME_OBJECT].translate!(hash)"
    Then [ADD_YOUR_VERIFICATION_HERE]

  Scenario: Testing translate! method with optional argument 'file_name' (Rename this to be more descriptive)
    Given I launch application [APPLICATION_NAME] as @app
    When I execute "@app.[SOME_OBJECT].translate!(hash, file_name)"
    Then [ADD_YOUR_VERIFICATION_HERE]

  Scenario: Testing translate! method with optional argument 'plurality' (Rename this to be more descriptive)
    Given I launch application [APPLICATION_NAME] as @app
    When I execute "@app.[SOME_OBJECT].translate!(hash, file_name, plurality)"
    Then [ADD_YOUR_VERIFICATION_HERE]

  Scenario: Testing translate! method with optional argument 'numerus' (Rename this to be more descriptive)
    Given I launch application [APPLICATION_NAME] as @app
    When I execute "@app.[SOME_OBJECT].translate!(hash, file_name, plurality, numerus)"
    Then [ADD_YOUR_VERIFICATION_HERE]

  Scenario: Testing translate! method with optional argument 'lengthvariant' (Rename this to be more descriptive)
    Given I launch application [APPLICATION_NAME] as @app
    When I execute "@app.[SOME_OBJECT].translate!(hash, file_name, plurality, numerus, lengthvariant)"
    Then [ADD_YOUR_VERIFICATION_HERE]
