Feature: MobyBehaviour::Application#close
  As a test scripter writer
  I want to use close method to [DO_SOMETHING] in [TARGET_APPLICATION]
  so that I can test the MobyBehaviour::Application behaviour

  Scenario: Testing close method with required argument(s) (Rename this to be more descriptive)
    Given I launch application [APPLICATION_NAME] as @app
    When I execute "@app.[SOME_OBJECT].close()"
    Then [ADD_YOUR_VERIFICATION_HERE]

  Scenario: Testing close method with optional argument 'options_hash' (Rename this to be more descriptive)
    Given I launch application [APPLICATION_NAME] as @app
    When I execute "@app.[SOME_OBJECT].close(options_hash)"
    Then [ADD_YOUR_VERIFICATION_HERE]
