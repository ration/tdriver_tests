  As a test scripter writer

  so that I can test the MobyBehaviour::SUT behaviour

  Scenario: Testing x_path attribute (Rename this to be more descriptive)
    Given I launch application [APPLICATION_NAME] as @app
    When I execute "@app.[SOME_OBJECT].x_path"
    Then [ADD_YOUR_VERIFICATION_HERE]
